title:  "Spaghetti Squash"
tags: vegan

ingredients:
- 1 spaghetti squash
- extra-virgin olive oil
- sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Slice the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds and ribbing. 
- Drizzle the inside of the squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
- Place the spaghetti squash cut side down on the baking sheet and use a fork to poke holes. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes (closer to 30) or until lightly browned on the outside, fork tender, but still a little bit firm. The time will vary depending on the size of your squash.
- Remove from the oven and flip the squash so that it’s cut side up. When cool to the touch, use a fork to scrape and fluff the strands from the sides.
