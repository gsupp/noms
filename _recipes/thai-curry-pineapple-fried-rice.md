title:  "Thai Curry Pineapple Fried Rice"
tags: vegan

ingredients:
- 1 cup rice
- 1 onion, chopped
- 3 cloves of garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon oil
- 2 carrots, cut into thin sticks
- 1/2 red bell pepper, cut into thin sticks
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 1/2 cup cashews
- 1 tablespoon coconut aminos
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 cup pineapple, cut into small pieces
- 2 green onions, cut into rings
- salt and black pepper, to taste
- red pepper flakes (optional)
- fresh cilantro (optional)

directions:
- I like the Thai pineapple fried rice best with left-over rice from the day before. So cook the rice according to the instructions on the package and store it in an air-tight container in the fridge until you use it. Cook the frozen peas for about 7 minutes.
- In a large pan, heat the oil and saut√© the onion for about 3 minutes. Then add the garlic, the carrots, and the bell pepper. Cook for 3 minutes.
- Then stir in the cooked rice and season with the curry powder and the soy sauce. Next, add the pineapple, the peas, the green onion, and the cashews. 
- Season with salt, black pepper, and if using red pepper flakes. Stir until well combined. Serve with fresh cilantro.
