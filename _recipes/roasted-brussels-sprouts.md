ingredients:
- Brussels sprouts
- Olive oil

directions:
- Cut off stems and remove outer leaves. You want to remove a fair amount of the stem, otherwise it'll be tough. For extra large brussel sprouts, cut in half.
- Toss with olive oil, salt and pepper.
- Bake at 400f for 20 to 30 minutes, or air fry for 12 to 14 minutes at 375f, shaking the tray/basket a few times during cooking to brown evenly.
