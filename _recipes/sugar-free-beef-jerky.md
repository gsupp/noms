title:  "Sugar Free Beef Jerky (Keto-friendly)"
tags: beef, keto

ingredients:
- 1 1/2lbs flank steak
- 1/2T salt
- 1/2t black pepper
- 1T galic powder
- 1/2T chili powder

directions:
- Freeze the steak for about 30 minutes to make it easier to slice.
- Preheat oven to 175f.
- Unfold the steak and remove any visible fat. The fat will shorten the jerky's shelf life, so it's best removed.
- Slice the meat against the grain in 1" wide strips, then slice lengthwise into two thinner, approximately 1/8" thick strips.
- Mix the seasonings together in a small bowl. 
- Place the beef strips into a large bowl and toss with the seasoning until evenly coated.
- Line a baking sheet with foil and place a cooling rack on top.
- Arrange the strips on the rack, leaving enough room so they don't touch.
- Bake for 4 to 6 hours, flipping the jerky a few times. You want the jerky to be dark brown, firm and dry, yet still pliable. Thicker cut pieces will take longer, thinner pieces sooner, so remove those and return the thicker pieces to the oven until done.
- Allow to cool and finish drying for 30 minutes. At this point, I like to vacuum seal the jerky into portions and place it in the refrigerator for the longest shelf life, although any air tight container will also work. It should keep for about a week in an air tight container, or up to two weeks when vacuum sealed.

Store bought jerky is often filled with preservatives, curing agents and sugar. This homemade jerky recipe is sugar free, no preservatives and uses no curing agents. As a result, the shelf life is shorter and it's recommended to vacuum seal and refrigerate it.
