title:  "Three Potato Soup"
tags: soup

ingredients:
- 3T olive oil or butter
- 1 small white onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4c flour
- 2c vegetable stock
- 2c milk, warmed
- 1/2 pound each -> red potatoes + (peeled) sweet potatoes + Yukon gold potatoes, diced
- 1c shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2c sour cream
- 2t Cajun seasoning
- 1t salt
- 1/2t black pepper
- optional toppings -> green onions or chives, extra shredded cheese, sour cream


directions:
- Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  Stir in the garlic and sauté for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.  
- Sprinkle the flour on top of the onion, and stir until combined.  Sauté for an additional minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally.  
- Gradually pour in the stock, and stir until combined.  Add in the milk and potatoes, and stir until combined.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer, but is not boiling.
- Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft, stirring every few minutes so that the bottom of the pot does not burn.  (The smaller you dice your potatoes, the faster they will cook.)
- Once the potatoes are tender, stir in the cheese, sour cream, Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper until combined.  Taste, and season with additional salt or pepper if needed.
- Serve warm, garnished with your desired toppings.  Or, transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
