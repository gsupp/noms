title:  "Stuffed Bell Peppers"
tags: beef

ingredients:
- 6 green bell peppers, tops cut away and seeds removed
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup finely chopped yellow onions
- 1/2 cup finely chopped green bell peppers
- 1/2 pound ground beef
- 1/2 pound ground pork
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- Pinch red pepper flakes
- 2 cups cooked long or medium-grain white rice
- 8 ounces tomato sauce
- Water

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
- In a large pot of boiling water, parboil the peppers until just tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and dry on paper towels.
- In a large saute pan or skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and chopped bell peppers and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the beef, pork, garlic, parsley, salt, black pepper, and pepper flakes. Cook until the meat is browned, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon to break up the lumps, about 6 minutes. Add the rice and tomato sauce and stir well. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.
- Pour enough water into a baking dish to just cover the bottom, about 1/8-inch deep. Stuff the bell peppers with the rice mixture and place in the baking dish. Bake until the peppers are very tender and the filling is heated through, 30-35 minutes.
- Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
