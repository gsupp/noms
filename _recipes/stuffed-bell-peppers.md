image: stuffed-bell-peppers.jpg
tags: beef

ingredients:
- 6 green bell peppers, tops cut away and seeds removed
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 cup finely chopped yellow onions or two shallots
- 1/2 cup finely chopped green bell peppers
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon oregano
- Pinch red pepper flakes
- 2 cups cooked long or medium-grain white rice
- 8 ounces tomato sauce
- 1 1/2 cup shredded cheese

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.
- In a large pot of boiling water, add the peppers and parboil until just tender, 3 to 4 minutes after the water returns to a boil. Remove with a slotted spoon and arrange in a baking dish sprayed with non-stick spray.
- In a large saute pan or skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and chopped bell peppers and cook, stirring, until soft, about 3 minutes. Add the beef, garlic, parsley, salt, black pepper, chili powder, cumin, oregano and pepper flakes. Cook until the meat is browned, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon to break up the lumps, about 6 minutes. 
- Add the tomato sauce and bring to a simmer. Add the rice and 1 cup of the shredded cheese and stir well. Remove from the heat and adjust the seasoning, to taste.
- Stuff the bell peppers with the rice mixture and top with the remaining shredded cheese. 
- Bake at 475f for 15 minutes or until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through.
- Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
