tags: beef, stir-fry

ingredients:
- 1lb ground beef
- 12oz broccoli crowns chopped into small pieces
- 2c cooked rice
- 2 green onions chopped (optional)
- sesame seeds (optional)
- 1/4c coconut aminos
- 1T brown sugar
- 2t minced garlic about 4 cloves
- 2t sesame oil
- 1t ground ginger
- 1/4-1/2t crushed red pepper, depending on taste
- 2t potato starch dissolved in 1/4c water

directions:
- Start the rice cooking first so that itâ€™s ready for serving.

- Brown ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until just cooked through, breaking it into bite-sized pieces as you go, but not crumbling. Drain the fat and return the beef to the pan.

- While the beef is cooking, combine the sauce ingredients (coconut aminos, brown sugar, minced garlic, sesame oil, ground ginger, crushed red pepper) and chop your broccoli. Stir the broccoli and sauce into the skillet with the browned ground beef.

- Continue to stir fry the beef and veggies over medium-high heat for about five minutes until broccoli is crisp-tender and sauce has thickened, stirring occasionally.

- Stir in potato starch and water to thicken into a sauce.

- Serve your beef & broccoli stir fry over cooked rice, topped with chopped green onion and sesame seeds (optional).
