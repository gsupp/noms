ingredients:
- 2 Tbsp olive oil

- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 6 large bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess skin
- 2 tsp finely minced fresh rosemary
- 2 tsp finely minced fresh thyme
- 3/4 tsp cornstarch
- 1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1 Tbsp minced fresh parsley

directions:
- Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Heat olive oil and butter in a large oven-proof skillet or saute pan over medium heat. 
- Add garlic and cook, turning occasionally until lightly browned, about 3 - 5 minutes. Transfer garlic to a plate, leave oil in pan. 
- Dab skin side of chicken thighs well with paper towels to dry. Season both sides of chicken with salt and pepper.
- Increase burner heat to medium-high and add chicken to skillet, skin side down (cover pan with a splatter screen if you have one). Cook until browned, about 5 - 6 minutes, then remove from heat.
- Season chicken thighs with 1 tsp each thyme an rosemary, then flip so skin side is upright and season with 1 tsp each thyme and rosemary.
- Scatter garlic cloves around chicken. Roast in preheated oven until skin is crispy and center registers 165, about 22 minutes.
- In a small bowl whisk together chicken broth and cornstarch. Transfer chicken and garlic to a plate, then bring drippings in skillet to a simmer over medium heat.
- Add broth mixture to drippings, and cook whisking constantly, 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.
- Add some of the pan sauce to individual plates then top with a chicken and garlic cloves. Sprinkle with parsley.
