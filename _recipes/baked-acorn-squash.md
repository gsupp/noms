title:  "Baked Acorn Squash with Butter and Brown Sugar"
tags: squash

ingredients:
- 1 acorn squash
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons maple syrup
- Dash kosher salt

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Using a sharp, sturdy chef's knife, carefully cut the acorn squash in half.
- Use a sturdy metal spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits inside each squash half, until the inside is smooth.
- Place the squash halves cut side up in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4 inch of water over the bottom of the pan so that the squash doesn't burn or get dried out in the oven.
- Rub 1/2 tablespoon butter into the insides of each half. Sprinkle with a little salt if you are using unsalted butter.
- Crumble 1 tablespoon brown sugar into the center of each half and drizzle with 1 teaspoon maple syrup.
- Bake at 400°F for about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the tops of the squash halves are nicely browned and the squash flesh is very soft and cooked through.
