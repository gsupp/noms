ingredients:
- 1 acorn squash
- 2t coconut oil
- 1T maple syrup (optional)
- Dash of salt
- Ground cinnamon

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 400f.
- Using a sharp, sturdy chef's knife, carefully cut the acorn squash in half.
- Use a sturdy metal spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits inside each squash half, until the inside is smooth.
- Place the squash halves cut side up in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4 inch of water into the bottom of the pan so that the squash doesn't burn or dry out.
- Rub 1t coconut oil on the insides of each half. 
- Drizzle 1/2T maple syrup into the center of each half.
- Sprinkle with a dash of salt and ground cinnamon to taste.
- Bake at 400f for about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the tops of the squash halves are nicely browned and the squash flesh is very soft and cooked through.
- Air Fryer -> 15 minutes at 350f upside down, then flip cut side up and 10 minutes at 400f.
