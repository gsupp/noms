title:  "Crispy Baked Eggplant"
image: crispy-baked-eggplant.jpg
tags: vegeterian

ingredients:
- 2 lbs small to medium-size eggplant (about 4-6 depending on exact size)
- 2 large eggs
- 3/4c plain panko breadcrumbs (use Rice Chex crumbs for a gluten-free option)
- 3/4c finely grated Parmesan cheese (can be omitted for dairy-free, sprinkle nutritional yeast after baking instead)
- 1t dried Italian Seasoning
- 1/2t each salt and freshly ground pepper
- Olive oil, for baking sheets
- Marinara sauce for dipping and/or serve with pasta

directions:
- Preheat oven to 375f. Thoroughly coat a baking sheet with olive oil.  (You may need to use two sheets.)
- In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs and 1T water. In another bowl (a pie plate works well), combine the panko or Rice Chex crumbs, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.
- Cut the eggplants into thick rounds. (I like them to be between 1/2 and 3/4 inches thick so they have time to brown in the oven before they become too soft.) Dip the eggplant slices in the egg mixture, letting the excess drip off. Dredge the dipped slices in the Parmesan mixture, pushing down gently to coat well. Transfer the coated slices to the baking sheet.
- Bake until golden brown on the bottom, 17-20 minutes. (Peek underneath using a spatula; if they aren’t yet golden, give them a few more minutes and check again.) Flip the slices and continue baking until lightly browned on the other side but still slightly firm, about 10 minutes more. All ovens vary, so don’t hesitate to adjust a few minutes either way. You want the first side to be golden brown; then worry more about doneness and texture than getting the second side equally browned. (When pressed for time, I have simply given the tops a quick broil rather than flipping and cooking for the additional 10 minutes.)
- Remove from the oven and serve as is or with a side of marinara sauce for dipping. Can also be served over pasta, drizzle the pasta with marinara sauce and top with crispy eggplant.
- Note -> If you’d like to try this recipe with larger eggplants, I recommend placing the slices in a colander and tossing with a half-teaspoon or so of salt. Allow the excess moisture to drain for 20-30 minutes, and then blot dry and proceed as directed.
