title:  "Chocolate Chia Seed Pudding"
tags: chocolate, pudding, vegan

ingredients:
- 1/4c unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2t stevia powder
- 1/2t ground cinnamon (optional)
- 1 pinch sea salt
- 1/2t vanilla extract
- 1.5c unsweetened almond/coconut/oat milk
- 1/4c chia seeds

directions:
- In a small mixing bowl, add cocoa powder, stevia,  cinnamon, salt, vanilla and whisk to combine. Add a little dairy-free milk at a time and whisk until a paste forms. Then add remaining milk and whisk until smooth.
- Add chia seeds and whisk to combine. Cover and refrigerate. Stir after 30-45 minutes. Let sit overnight, or at least 3-5 hours (until it's achieved a pudding-like consistency).
- Leftovers keep covered in the fridge for 4-5 days, though best when fresh. Serve chilled with desired toppings, such as fruit (banana, strawberry, raspberry), shredded coconut, granola, nuts, or coconut whipped cream.
