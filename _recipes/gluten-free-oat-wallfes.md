title:  "Gluten Free Oat Waffles"
tags: breakfast, gf

ingredients:
- 1.5c oat flour
- 2t baking powder
- 1/2t salt
- Pinch of cinnamon (optional)
- 3/4c room temperature milk (light coconut, oat, almond or cow’s milk)
- 1/4c + 1T melted coconut oil or 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs
- 2T maple syrup
- 1t vanilla extract

directions:
- In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: oat flour, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. 
- In another bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients: milk, melted coconut oil or butter, eggs, maple syrup and vanilla extract. (If your coconut oil solidifies on contact with cold ingredients, gently heat the wet mixture in the microwave in ten seconds intervals, until it melts again.)
- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir with a big spoon until just combined (the batter will still be a little lumpy). 
- Let the batter rest for 10 minutes so the oat flour has time to soak up some of the moisture. Plug in your waffle iron to preheat now (if your waffle iron has a temperature/browning dial, set it to medium-high).
- Once 10 minutes is up, give the batter one more swirl with your spoon. Pour batter onto the heated waffle iron, enough to cover the center and most of the central surface area, and close the lid. 
- Once the waffle is deeply golden and crisp, transfer it to a cooling rack or baking sheet. Don’t stack your waffles on top of each other, or they’ll lose crispness. 
- If desired, keep your waffles warm by placing them in a 200 degree oven until you’re ready to serve.
- Repeat with remaining batter. Serve waffles with maple syrup and nut butter, fruit, or any other toppings that sound good!

This is a versatile recipe that can also be used to make pancakes in absence of a waffle iron or cookies, if the milk is omitted (make tsp sized balls and flatten on cookie sheet, bake at 325f for 20 minutes). I've also used stevia in place of the maple syrup, just increase the cooking time slightly as it won't brown as quickly without the sugar.

The eggs can be completely omitted, if preferred. The waffles will be more crumbly, but still turn out delicious.

Dairy free -> You can use non-dairy milk such as light coconut, oat or almond milk and coconut oil to make it dairy free.

Vegan -> Skip the eggs, use non-dairy milk and coconut oil.

Storage -> Waffles freeze well. Just store in freezer-safe plastic bags and pop individual waffles into the toaster until warmed through.

DIY oat flour -> Simply blend old-fashioned or quick-cooking oats (make sure it specifically says gluten-free) in a food processor or blender until they are ground into a fine flour. You’ll need to blend roughly 1 1/2 cups oats to make enough flour for these waffles.
