This recipe is written for a Hotlogic Mini in a 6 cup Pyrex container. If your bread is not stale, you can dice it and cook in the Hotlogic until it dries out, about 1 hour. Leave the top unzipped and your container loosely covered so the moisture can escape. You can add diced fruit to this recipe as a variation, apples pair especially well.
