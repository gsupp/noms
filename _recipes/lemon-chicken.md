title:  "Lemon Chicken"
tags: chicken

ingredients:
- 1 lbs chicken, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 1/2 cups cornstarch
- 3 cups peanut or vegetable oil
- 3-5 Lemons
- Rice
- Marinade ->
- 1 tablespoon coconut aminos
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 eggs
- Sauce ->
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon ginger
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
- 4 teaspoons grated lemon zest
- 1 tablespoon coconut aminos 
- 4 tablespoons sugar
- 1 teaspoons cornstarch, dissolved in 1 tablespoons water

directions:
- Marinate the chicken -> In a medium bowl, combine the coconut aminos, sesame oil, and eggs. Add the chicken and stir. Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes.
- Spread the 1 1/2 cups of cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss the chicken cubes in the cornstarch and shake off any excess before frying.
- Heat the oil in a wok or heavy-bottomed pot until it registers 350 degrees F on an instant-read oil thermometer. Working in 2 or 3 batches, add the chicken cubes and fry until lightly golden on the outside and cooked through, about 3-5 minutes. Remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on a plate lined with paper towels. 
- (Optional -> To get the chicken extra-crispy, allow the chicken to drain and cool for about 5 minutes, then return the chicken to the wok to fry for another 30 seconds, until golden brown.)
- Prepare the sauce -> Heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon oil. Add the garlic and ginger and cook briefly until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken stock, lemon juice, lemon zest, coconut aminos, and sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and simmer. Stir in the cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce.
