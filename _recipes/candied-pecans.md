ingredients:
- 3/4 c brown sugar
- 3 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 3 Tbl water
- 4 c pecans halves

directions:
- Heat all ingredients, except nuts, until bubbling.  
- Add nuts and stir and continue to cook until all the water evaporates.  
- Continue stirring and cooking until the nuts become super shiny, and all liquid is gone.  
- Transfer to parchment paper, spread out to single layer if possible to cool.  Break apart if needed after they cool.
- If they are still too sticky, they need to cook longer.  You can return to pan and continue cooking but be careful of burning!
