title:  "Gluten Free Brownies"
tags: chocolate, baking

ingredients:
- 2/3c semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips
- 5T coconut oil (or butter, avocado oil, vegan butter, ghee)
- 2/3c sugar (white, coconut, brown, or maple sugar)
- 2 eggs
- 1t vanilla extract
- 2/3c blanched almond flour (or oat flour)
- 2T unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2t baking soda (if paleo) or baking powder
- 1/4t salt
- 2/3c additional chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (can sub nuts)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350f. Line an 8×8 baking pan with parchment paper or spray with nonstick spray.
- In a small saucepan, melt chocolate and oil over low heat until smooth and glossy. Remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.
- In a small bowl, whisk together sugar and eggs until slightly lighter in color and until they pass the ribbon test (when you lift the whisk the mixture should stream down evenly in “ribbons”). Set aside.
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients–almond flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt.
- Working slowly, whisk the egg/sugar mixture into the saucepan of melted chocolate. Whisk until smooth. Stir in vanilla and mix in.
- Stir in the dry ingredients and fold until just mixed.
- Fold in the additional chocolate chips.
- Pour batter into your prepared pan and smooth the surface.
- Bake at 350f for 20-22 minutes, or until edges are set and the center is still ever so slightly underdone. (The remaining heat should set the center as it cools.) Don't overcook or they'll end up super crumbly. Allow brownies to cool before slicing.
