tags: vegan

ingredients:
- Sauce
- 1/2c creamy peanut butter
- 1/4c coconut aminos
- 3T apple cider vinegar
- 2T maple syrup
- 1t grated fresh ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, pressed
- 1/4t red pepper flakes
- 2T water
- Vegetables
- 2 sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced into 1in long, 1/2in wide chunks
- 1 red bell pepper, cored, deseeded, and sliced into bite-sized strips
- 2T coconut oil (or olive oil)
- 1/4t cumin powder
- Salt, to taste 
- Rice and garnishes
- 1 1/4c brown rice
- 2 to 3 green onions, sliced
- Handful cilantro, torn
- Handful peanuts, crushed
- Sriracha sauce on the side (optional)

directions:
- Prep: Bring a large pot of water to boil. Preheat the oven to 425f with a rack in the middle and another rack near the top.
- Roast the vegetables: On a large, rimmed baking sheet, toss the sweet potato with a generous tablespoon of coconut oil, the cumin and a sprinkle of salt. Arrange them in a single layer, and set aside.
- On a separate, smaller baking sheet, toss the bell pepper with about 1 teaspoon of coconut oil and a sprinkle of salt. Toss until lightly coated, and arrange them in a single layer.
- Roast the sweet potatoes on the middle rack for about 35 minutes, tossing halfway, and roast the peppers on the top rack for about 25 minutes, tossing halfway. The vegetables will be tender and caramelized on the edges when they are ready.
- In the meantime, cook the rice.
- Make the sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the sauce ingredients. If the sauce is too thick or too spicy, whisk in a little more water.
- Serve: In bowls, divide the rice and roasted vegetables. Drizzle each bowl generously with sauce, and top with a sprinkle of green onions, cilantro and peanuts.
