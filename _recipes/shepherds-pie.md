image: shepherds-pie.jpg
tags: beef, lamb, comfort

ingredients:
- 3-4 large (1 1/2 to 2lbs) potatoes, peeled and quartered
- 8T (1/2c) butter
- 1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2c)
- 1-2c vegetables—diced carrots, corn, peas
- 1 1/2 pounds ground lamb or beef
- 1/2c beef broth
- 2T Worcestershire sauce
- 1t crushed rosemary
- 1t thyme 
- 1 bayleaf
- Salt and pepper, other seasonings of choice

directions:
- Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).
- While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4T of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.
- Add vegetables according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do. If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time. 
- Add the ground meat to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme.
- Add the Worcestershire sauce, beef broth and bayleaf. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.
- When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), add the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter, mash and season with salt and pepper to taste.
- Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (remove bayleaf) in an even layer in a large greased baking dish (9x13 casserole).
- Spread the mashed potatoes over the top. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned.
- Place in oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown. (Do not broil in Pyrex or glass dishes, they can shatter from the heat.)

Suggested variations  
- Sprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes before baking.
- Put a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the mashed potatoes.
