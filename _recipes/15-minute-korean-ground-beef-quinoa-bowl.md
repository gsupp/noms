tags: beef, entree

ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground ginger
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 2 1/2 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1/4 cup coconut aminos
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more if you like it spicy
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced

directions:
- Place the quinoa in a small stock pot and cover with 2 cups water or chicken stock. Bring to a full boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and let cook for 15 minutes.
- While the quinoa cooks, heat the oil in a large pan. Add the ground beef and brown completely. Drain most of the fat. Clear room in the pan to cook the garlic and ginger for about 1 minute or until fragrant.
- In a small bowl, combine maple syrup, coconut aminos, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.
- Add the sauce mixture to the ground beef and let cook for 3-5 minutes to allow the flavors to set.
- Once the quinoa is done, take off the heat and fluff with a fork. Serve beef over quinoa, top with green onion.
