Cornbread is traditionally sweet, I'd recommend serving with honey for those that aren't sugar-free.

This recipe also works well for making cornbread muffins. Simply use a muffin pan instead.

The batter should be thick enough to not pour easily.

It is important to grease pan and chop peppers before starting. Allowing mixture to stand, then disturbing will reduce the effectiveness of the baking powder.
