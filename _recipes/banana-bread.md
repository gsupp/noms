title:  "Banana Bread"
image: banana-bread.jpg
tags: bread, gf, df, dairy-free, gluten-free

ingredients:
- 3 to 4 medium (7" to 8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/2 cups mashed)
- 1/3c coconut oil, melted
- 1t baking soda (or 3t baking powder)
- 1 pinch salt
- 1t cinnamon
- 2T maple syrup
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1t vanilla extract
- 1 1/2c almond flour

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350f, and spray a 4x8-inch loaf pan with non-stick spray.
- In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir in the melted coconut oil.
- Mix in the baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Stir in the maple syrup, beaten egg and vanilla extract. Mix in the almond flour.
- Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350f or air fry 35 to 37 minutes at 310f, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until fully baked.
- Remove from oven and let cool in the pan. Remove from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice with a bread knife and serve.
- Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 3 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.

This recipe contains no refined sugars or dairy and is gluten free. The almond flour gives it a nice thick crust with a bit of a crunch. For a twist, try adding chocolate chips.
