title:  "Banana Bread"
image: banana-bread.jpg
tags: bread, gf, df, dairy-free, gluten-free

ingredients:
- 3 to 4 medium (7" to 8" long) very ripe bananas, peeled (about 1 1/2 cups mashed)
- 1/3 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups almond flour

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350째F (175째C), and spray a 4x8-inch loaf pan with non-stick spray.
- In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir in the melted coconut oil.
- Mix in the baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Stir in the maple syrup, beaten egg and vanilla extract. Mix in the almond flour.
- Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake -> 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350째F (175째C), Air fryer -> 35 to 37 minutes at 310f, or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.
- Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)
- Wrapped well, the banana bread will keep at room temperature for 4 days. For longer storage, refrigerate the loaf up to 5 days, or freeze it.

This recipe contains no refined sugars or dairy and is gluten free. The almond flour gives it a nice thick crust with a bit of a crunch. For a twist, try adding chocolate chips.
