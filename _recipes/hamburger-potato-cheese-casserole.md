title:  "Hamburger Potato Cheese Casserole"
tags: beef

ingredients:
- 5 large russet potatoes, peeled and sliced about 1/4-1/2 inch thick
- 2-3 tablespoons chopped onions
- 1 lb ground beef
- salt and pepper
- Cheese sauce ->
- 2 cups almond, cashew or oat milk
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons gluten-free flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 8 ounces shredded sharp cheddar cheese

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350.
- Brown hamburger and onion.
- Place a layer of sliced potatoes in casserole dish, top with half of hamburger/onion mixture. Salt and pepper to taste (kind of depends on how salty your cheese sauce is - you can always salt it later if it needs it).
- Repeat layering of potato slices and hamburger mixture (and salt and pepper if desired).
- Make Cheese sauce ->
- Melt 3 T butter in saucepan over med-high heat.
- Add 3 T flour, and the salt and pepper. Stir quickly to blend.
- Add 2 cups milk; stir with whisk to incorporate butter/flour mixture.
- Reduce heat, stir till thickened and bubbly.
- Remove from heat and add shredded cheddar. Stir until cheese melts.
- Pour cheese sauce over hamburger and potatoes in baking dish. Push potatoes around to let cheese sauce into all of the crevices so it's well coated.
- Cover and place in oven. Bake for about 1 1/2 hours, till potatoes are tender and top is browned. I like to take off the lid for the last 20 minutes or so to brown the top a bit.
