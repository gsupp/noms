title:  "Vegan Peanut Butter Cookies"
image: vegan-peanut-butter-cookies.jpg
tags: vegan, cookies

ingredients:
- 1c natural peanut butter, creamy or crunchy (or almond butter)
- 3/4c coconut or date sugar
- 6T almond milk, room temp
- 2t vanilla extract
- 1c flour (light spelt, unbleached all-purpose, 1–1 gluten free)
- 1t baking soda
- generous pinch of sea salt (only use if peanut butter is unsalted)


directions:
- Preheat the oven to 350f. Line a cookie sheet with silicone mat, parchment paper or leave ungreased.
- In a large bowl, add the peanut butter and sugar and mix until creamy. Stir in the almond milk and vanilla. Next, add the flour, baking soda and salt, mix to combine. The dough will be tough to stir, using your hands to mix it together will be easier.
- Roll and flatten -> Using a 1.5 tablespoon scooper, scoop out the dough and roll into balls, about 1 1/4 inch. Place the balls of dough about 2 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Using the back of a fork, flatten in a crisscross pattern. Optionally, sprinkle with sugar or coarse salt.
- Bake -> Place in the oven and bake for 10-13 minutes (13 minutes will yield a crispier cookie that’s tender inside). Let cool a few minutes, transfer cookies to a wire rack and repeat with remaining dough.
- Makes 20-24 cookies.
- Cookies can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for 5 days. To keep longer, store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Let cookies cool completely, store in a freezer safe container for up to 2 months.

NOTES  
If you don’t have baking soda on hand, baking powder works great too.

When flattening, dip the fork in sugar between pressing the cookie to keep them from sticking.

If allergic to peanuts, use almond butter or sunbutter instead.
